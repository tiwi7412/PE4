Our code implements a simple game of tic tac toe. When running the code, A display will pop up asking for the first player to input what column they would like to choose, then what row they would like to choose. Then the code places the change and it goes to the next persons turn. It then repeats and player 2 chooses where they like to go and this continues til 9 turns are up. One thing to note is that inputs should be correct to arrays in c++. For example, the top left square is (0,0), not (1,1).
